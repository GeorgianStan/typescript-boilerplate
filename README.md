# TypeScript Boilerplate

This repository is a boilerplate for scripts and small projects that are intended to be written in TypeScript without the need to set up and configure a complex project.

## How to Run

Run `npm ci` to install the dependencie.

- To run the code in **watch** mode, open the a terminal and type `npx nodemon` followed by the path to the file you want to execute.

  _example_: `npx nodemon src\my-script.ts`

- To execute a script only once use `npx ts-node` followed by the path to the file you want to execute,

  _example_: `npx ts-node src\my-script.ts`

For both variants there will be no output(build/distribution) of the code.
